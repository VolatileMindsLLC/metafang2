MetasploitPayloadUtility
========================

Interfaces with a Metasploit RPC instance to generate .NET executables that run x86/x64 shell code in a platform-agnostic way. One binary to rule them all.

Log in to the msfrpcd instance with a url like "https://127.0.0.1:55553/api", and the credentials set up when starting msfrpcd.

Under active development.
